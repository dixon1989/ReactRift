# ReactRift - React Native Learning Project

This project is a result of my continuous learning journey in React Native development. Created as a part of ongoing education, this mobile app encapsulates best practices, industry-standard patterns, and innovative solutions to common challenges faced in the realm of mobile app development.

ReactRift react-native expo app.

This is a Managed Expo App, do not commit any generated ios folder.

## Building and running dev via expo-go

Install prerequisites with `yarn install`

To build and run locally in a simulator, emulator or device simply run `yarn start-go` and press `a` or `i` to open expo-go in the ios simulator. This will open the app in the expo-go app.

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android - JDK 17 Required*

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
